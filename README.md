# leaflet-challenge

In this project I referenced the United States Geological Survey (USGS) for earthquake data over the last 7 days. I used the URL from the JSON representation provided by USGS to visualize the data on a map using Leaflet. I included popups showing the magnitude, depth, and location of each earthquake and a legend representing the depths.
